jquery-museum
=============

A zero-clutter jQuery image gallery.

[View Demo](http://muratayfer.com/secret-box/jquery-museum/)

* Single file.
* Works well on desktop &amp; mobile. Centered by default, zooming in mobile is smooth.
* Clicking the image goes to the next one.
* Clicking outside the image closes the overlay.
* No other animations or styling.

Just add `<script src='jquery.museum.js'></script>` to your head and initialize it with `$.museum($('#relevant-context img'));`. Make sure the selected elements are `<img>` tags.
